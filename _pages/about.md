I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at Iwate University Graduate School (enrolled in October 2024). My research focuses on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and I am utilizing data balancing techniques to improve model accuracy by balancing datasets. The methods I use include deep learning algorithms such as `GAN`, `CGAN`, `CWGAN`, `WGAN-GP`, along with the `SOMTE` method.

In my research, combining `CNN_LSTM` with the `SOMTE` method, the classification results on the NSL-KDD 40-class dataset have reached 99%, effectively learning the minority class data. This result highlights the importance of data balancing techniques in improving model performance and provides strong support for further research.

### Research and Development Experience

During my graduate studies, I primarily use Python for data analysis, focusing on feature extraction and optimizing classification methods for network traffic data. Additionally, I have participated in projects related to image processing. In October of this year, I assisted a senior colleague with their graduation thesis project, successfully implementing semantic segmentation techniques on satellite images to analyze post-disaster damage to roads and buildings.

### Skills and Expertise

I am proficient in several programming languages, including Java, Go, and Python, and I am also capable of developing with JavaScript. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a web system related to network security, integrating intrusion detection and data analysis modules into the system. I am currently improving the project and adding new features.

Additionally, I have a strong interest in Large Language Models (LLM). Although my experience in this area is limited, I have a strong desire to learn and quickly adapt to new technologies.

### Future Outlook

I am passionate about artificial intelligence and the latest technologies, particularly in AI and image processing applications. I look forward to joining more practical research and development projects, continuously enhancing my professional skills, and contributing to technological innovation.
